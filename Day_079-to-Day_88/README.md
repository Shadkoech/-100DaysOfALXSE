Over these 10 days, I successfully completed the project Olkisir and even hosted it on vercel for the frontend and render for the backend. 
Alongside my team, we were able to:

- Define the scope and requirements of the Dispatch-Returns System
- Design and implement the system to track goods from dispatch to delivery.
- Integrated features for handling product returns, addressing issues like incorrect shipments, surplus inventory, and damaged goods.
- Incorporated unique order IDs for enhanced process transparency and efficient management.
- Successfully hosted the project on Vercel and Render, ensuring it is accessible and operational.

## Outcome:
The Olkisir system is now fully functional, offering an optimized solution for sales order handling and product returns management, ultimately improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
