# Day_003

Day_003 of the #100daysof code and today I am handling an interview question.

## Overview

This interview question is based on a string problem. 
The task is to write a function that determines whether two strings are anagrams. 
	- Anagrams are words or phrases that are formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase using all the original letters all exactly once. In simpler terms, anagrams are words that have the same characters but in a different order.

Examples of anagrams:
- "listen" and "silent"
- "debit card" and "bad credit"


## Task

Filename:

	- anagrams.py
Holds a function is_anagram() which takes two arguments s1 and s2 and returns True if the two strings are anagrams and False otherwise.
