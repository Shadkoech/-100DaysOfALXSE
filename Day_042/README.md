After going though user authentication yesterday, today I tackled a number of tasks to orchestrate this.


## Overview
This project builds on the previous concepts of basic and session authentication. It aims to implement a user authentication system using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It follows industry best practices by using SQLAlchemy for database interactions and bcrypt for password hashing. The project includes various tasks such as creating user models, implementing registration, login, logout, profile management, password reset functionalities, and end-to-end integration tests.

## Learning objectives
Key concepts I came across:
- Gain understanding of API routing in Flask
- How to work with cookies and session management
- How to use SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- Implement password hashing for secure user authentication
