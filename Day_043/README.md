Today I implemented an end to integration test on the user authentication system that I built


## Overview
The nd-to-end integration test for an application is a test suite that provides a comprehensive evaluation of your web server's functionality by simulating real-world scenarios. By creating and executing individual functions for various tasks, you'll ensure that your application behaves as expected across different user interactions.

## Testing Approach
1. Start Your Application: Open a new terminal window and start your application.
2. Create Main Module: Create a new module named main.py to organize your test functions.
3. Task Functions: Implement one function for each task listed below. Utilize the requests module to query your web server for the corresponding endpoints.
4. Assertion: Use assert statements to validate the response's expected status code and payload (if any) for each task.
