Day 11 and I had the chance to introduce myself to NoSQL(Not Only SQL). 

## Overview
NoSQL databases, also known as "Not Only SQL," are a category of databases that provide a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in a way other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Unlike traditional SQL databases, which adhere to the relational model and use structured query language (SQL), NoSQL databases offer a more flexible and scalable approach to data storage and retrieval.

Some of the key concepts that I read and researched on as characteristics and features of NoSQL include:

- `Schema-less`: NoSQL databases are typically schema-less, meaning that they do not require a predefined schema or structure for data. This allows for greater flexibility in handling various types of data, especially in applications with evolving data requirements.

- `Horizontal Scalability`: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, meaning that they can handle large volumes of data by distributing it across multiple nodes or servers. This makes them well-suited for applications with high scalability demands, such as web applications and big data analytics.

- `Flexible Data Models`: NoSQL databases support various data models, including key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-family, and graph databases. Each data model offers unique advantages and is optimized for specific use cases, allowing developers to choose the most suitable model for their application needs.

- `High Availability and Fault Tolerance`: Many NoSQL databases are built with distributed architectures that ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Data replication and automatic failover mechanisms help maintain data consistency and reliability, even in the event of node failures or network partitions.

- `Performance`: NoSQL databases are often optimized for high-performance data access and retrieval. They employ efficient data storage and indexing techniques, as well as parallel processing and caching mechanisms, to deliver low-latency responses and handle large concurrent workloads.
