Started the week by introducing myself to NextJS. Being a framework that built on ReactJS and a tool for building fastand search engine friendly applications, I saw it fit to add into my skillset. 
Today I handled the following:
- Setting up working environment and spinning a NextJS app
- Understanding the key files in NextJS
- Routing and navigation
- Client vs server components
- Data Fetching
