Today I introduced myself to Internationalization (i18n) and localization "L10n" in Flask

## Overview
"i18n" is a commonly used abbreviation for "internationalization." The term refers to the process of designing and developing software or products in a way that makes them adaptable to different languages and cultural conventions without requiring significant changes to the underlying codebase.

"L10n" is another common abbreviation used in the context of software development and localization. It stands for "localization. "L10n" involves adapting a product or software to a specific locale or market, including translating text, adjusting cultural elements, and modifying functionality to suit the preferences and requirements of users in that locale. This process ensures that the product feels native to users in different regions, improving user experience and accessibility
