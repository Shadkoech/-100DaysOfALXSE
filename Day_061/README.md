Went back to Day_059


" After going through a number of concepts for the past 3 months such as authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing; today I began the process of building a simple platform to upload and view files. 


The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:
- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images

## Tasks
Today, I started implementing the project
Using NodeJs, I was able to create RedisClient as well as MongoDB client. 
I also created APIs and mapped their functionalities in a views controllers

## Progress and file system
