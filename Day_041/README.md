Today I read and familiarized on user authentication.
This concept builds on both the concepts of basic and session authentication. I learnt about using SQLAlchemy for database interaction with bcrypt for password hashing. 

Key concepts I came across:
- Gain understanding of API routing in Flask
- How to work with cookies and session management
- How to use SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- Implement password hashing for secure user authentication
