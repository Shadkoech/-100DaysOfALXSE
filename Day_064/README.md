Today I challenged myself on an assessmentment question.
Went back to python to apply the concepts of: game theory, algorithmic optimization, Sieve of Eratosthenes and Dynamic Programming/Memoization to code a Prime Game.
Challenge:
- Maria and Ben engage in a strategic game consisting of multiple rounds. Each round involves a set of consecutive integers from 1 to a specific limit 𝑛. Players take turns selecting prime numbers from this set and eliminating them along with their multiples. The player unable to make a move loses the round.
- The task is to create the isWinner(x, nums) function, where 𝑥 represents the number of rounds played and nums is an array containing the limits 𝑛 for each round. The function should identify the player who wins the most rounds, assuming Maria starts first and both players employ optimal strategies. If the winner cannot be determined, the function should return None.
