# 100 Days of Code Challenge

## The challenge
The challenge is simple: code for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days. No days off! Whether it's learning a new language, working on personal projects, or solving coding problems, the goal is to dedicate time to coding every single day.

## The Mission
The mission of this challenge is to cultivate consistency and discipline in our coding practice. By committing to coding every day, I aim to foster continuous growth and development as software engineer.

## The goals
1. Improve Coding Skills: 
By consistently practicing coding, I aim to enhance our programming proficiency and tackle more complex challenges.
2. Enhance Problem-solving Abilities:
Regular coding sessions provide ample opportunities to encounter and solve various problems, sharpening sharpening problem-solving skills.
3. Increase Accountability: 
By publicly documenting our progress, I hold ourselves accountable for my coding goals, fostering a sense of responsibility.
4. Expand Networking: 
Engaging in coding challenges and sharing progress updates can lead to connections with other developers, creating opportunities for collaboration and learning.


## Repository Structure
- Log Files: Each day, I will log my progress in detail, including what I worked on and any challenges encountered.
- Code Samples: I may include snippets of code or links to repositories where I'm working on projects.
- Resources: I'll share helpful resources, tutorials, or articles that contribute to my learning journey.

## My Take
I am excited to take up this challenge and push myself to the very end. I'm on a personal test of consistency here and to pay homage to the famous quote by Denzel Washington, 

"Without commitment, you'll never start. But more importantly, without consistency, you'll never finish."

I have also added to the challenge, 100 pushups and 100 free squats to go with the number.
