This was a packed day.

I looked into postman as my continued daily series of learning the tool. After installing Postman, I covered the following concepts:

	- Introduction to API/Webservices
	- Setting up Postman
	- Postman UI
	- Types of HTTP request to test on the tool

## Overview
Postman is a powerful API (Application Programming Interface) development tool that simplifies the process of testing, documenting, and managing APIs. It offers a user-friendly interface for building, testing, and debugging APIs, making it an essential tool for developers, testers, and API consumers. 

The tool achieves the following:
- API testing
- API documentation
- Collaboration
- Mock Servers
- Monitoring
- API collections
- Environments
- Integration
