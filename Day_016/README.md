Today, I delved into REST API Design: Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination

## Purpose
REST API design principles encompasses various aspects that ensures that there is an efficient communication between clients and servers. Filtering, sorting, and pagination are crucial components that significantly enhance the usability and performance of REST APIs.

### Filtering
Filtering allows clients to narrow down on the results returned by an API based on a given criteria or conditions. It allows clients to retrieve only the data that they need and in the process reduce unnecessary data transfer and processing

### Sorting
Allows clients to request data in a specific order such as ascending or descending based on certain attributes. Allows clients to receive data in a format that best suits their needs without additional client-seide processing.

### Pagination
Pagination addresses the challenges of handling large datasets by breaking them into smaller, manageable chunks or pages. This prevents overwhelming clients with a large amount of data in a single response and in the process cut on bandwith usage.
