On this day I learnt how to perform unit testing with JavaScript using various frameworks such as Chai, Mocha, Sinon etc
This is a very important concept in development framework since it helps detect bugs early and ensure the development of high quality code.

I read and went through the following:

- How to use Mocha to write a test suite
- How to use different assertion libraries (Node or Chai)
- How to present long test suites
- When and how to use spies
- When and how to use stubs
- What are hooks and when to use them
- Unit testing with Async functions
- How to write integration tests with a small node server
