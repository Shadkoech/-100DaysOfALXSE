# Day_009

Day_009 of the #100daysofalxse #DoingHardThings
On this day, I took it as a refresher opportunity and dived deep into Javascript DOM

## Overview
Document Object Model (DOM) is created by the browser when a webpage is loaded. It actually appears as a tree of elements/nodes and Javascript can be used to read or change the DOM. Some of the actions that can be achieved through the interactions include:
	- Change/Remove HTML elements in the DOM / on the page
	- Change and add CSS styles to elements
	- Read and change element attributes(href, src, alt, custom)
	- Create new HTML elements and insert them into the DOM/page
	- Attach event listeners to elements(click, keypress, submit)



## Task
- creating a web app app and in the process learn how to interact with different element
